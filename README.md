# Welcome to r3sources!
## What is r3sources?
r3sources is pretty much a personal project of mine that tries to collect alternatives to paid services. <br />

There *are* a bunch of "free resources" websites out there but I would like to put my own spin to it :)

## Why is it named "r3sources"?
I put a 3 in my name (x3non), I put a 3 in r3sources (except the last one). <br />
Also I think it looks aesthetically pleasing.
